##description
IHTF, or I Have This Food, is a web application that allows MIT students with excess of MIT Dining meal swipes to donate meal swipes to students who have poor access to food and request them. The app will create a match between students who create requests to donate swipes and students who create requests to receive swipes. The app will facilitate the meeting of the two before entering the dining hall. 

### Proof of Concept
The proof of concept will contain a simplified version of the app and will allow for logging in and out, creating donating and receiving requests, and a rudimentary matching algorithm.
